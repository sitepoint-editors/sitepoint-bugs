# SitePoint Errata

A repository for bug reports and general reader feedback

## What should I submit?

Any of these:

- misinformation in posts
- badly categorized articles (if you see a post in the wrong category)
- outdated posts that desperately need a revamp
- missing syntax highlights in posts
- missing series parts (series ends abruptly after part 1 - common in super-old posts)

Feel free to also report:

- sites copying our work outright
- people badmouthing us
- posts about SitePoint that are obviously wrong and/or spreading misconceptions
- anything else *negative* that you can think of

## What should I **not** submit?

- layout glitches
- missing fonts
- 500 errors
- missing repositories from posts
- dead links

All of the above should be reported directly to support@sitepoint.com
